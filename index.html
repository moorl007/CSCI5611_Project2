<h2>List of features attempted and description</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Multiple Ropes
        <ul>
            <li>The existance of multiple ropes is clearly seen in every video linked below.  In order for the flag to act as a cloth, multiple ropes must be present</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cloth Simulation
        <ul>
            <li>I created the cloth by creating 40 springs, each with 20 nodes.  This creates a grid of nodes which has dimension 20X40.</li>
            <li>I obviously connected nodes which were directly above and below itself with springs, and I also connect nodes directly to the right or left with springs.  This means that nodes in the middle of the grid are connected to four other nodes, nodes on the edge are connected to three other nodes, and corner nodes are connected to two other nodes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>3D Simulation
        <ul>
            <li>I used the CAMERA class created by Liam Tyler</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Air drag for cloth
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple agents can be added by the user and each will have their own path to the goal</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ripping Tearing
        <ul>
            <li>I chose to use boids as my crowd simulation</li>
            <li>The agents will not collide with one another</li>
            <li>If the agents have no path to the goal, they will continue to move in a boid like fashion</li>
            <li>Once all of the agents have arrived at the goal, they don't like to get too close to each other so will go to the outside of the crowd sourounding the goal.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Code</h2>
<p>I modified the original Proj1_Test.pde code to run my simulations, modified PRM.pde to run my path finding, and used Vec2.pde and CollisionLibrary.pde to assist with vector math and collision detection, respectively.</p>

<h2>Tools and Libraries</h2>
<p>I used the camera class created by Liam Tyler to move the camera around the 3D environment, as well as Processing to display the behavior of my simulations.</p>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<p>The main difficulty I had was tuning the parameters, such as spring constant, damping constant, and timestep in order to get compelling looking results.
    The problem was that I would need to increase the spring constant so the cloth wouldn't look so stretchy, but when that constant grows too large, 
    the closth has a tendency to spontaneously explode.  I would then try to decrease the timestep, but that made the simulation run really slow.  
    Eventually I found a combination of parameters that I found pleasing.  Another difficulty I found was when I was adding flag tearing, the flag
    really wanted to explode when it ripped.  The problem was occuring in the part of the code where I was calculating air resistnace.  I was still calculating the air 
    resistnace for triangles that were supposed to be ripped, so nodes were getting incorrect forces applied to them.  I solved this by not doing air resistnace
    calculations on triangles that were ripped.
